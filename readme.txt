4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I spoke to multiple of the TA asking if this was fine if it didn't look exactly like the one in the examples
I also spoke with Ahtziri however it was just about how hard were the later parts and nothing on the project contents themselves

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
I hope it's good enough :)
